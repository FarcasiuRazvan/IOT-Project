A BELL FOR NOISE
I thought of an alarm or "a bell" for "noisy" homes, such that when a family argues about something 
and they raise their voices, an alarm will start ringing. This kind of device will be useful for parties also,
such that if you want to make a party and you worry about the neighbours, who might complain about the noise,
with this device you will know when the party is too loud and you can take action and make it more quiet.
